Introduction
------------

PTX CMS is my own content management system based on Zend Framework. 
I've decided to write it after I tried 3 times to use WordPress but I've never got
passion to use it.

PTX CMS support:
- ACL
- Langugages
- Static Pages, Categories, Tags, Photogallery

I've been continuosly improving it to be more useful.
